# ID & Class attributes

Following are the 2 main element attributes that help us to identify and classify elements for styling purposes.

## id attribute

It is the unique identifier for the HTML element that it is applied to. ID must be unique in the page.

## class attribute

It represents a classifier mostly used for styling purposes. When used semantically, it is generally used to represent a subtype, a module or a re-usable feature. It can contain one or more words seperated by a period (space). Each word is called a class name.

Example & usage of the ID & CLASS attribute.

```html
<body>
  <section id="user-detail-panel">
    <table class="table-bordered table-striped">
      <tr>
        <td>column1</td>
        <td>column2</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <table class="table-striped">
      <tr>
        <td>column1</td>
        <td>column2</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
