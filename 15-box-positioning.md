# CSS Box Positioning

The position property determines the way an element gets positioned in the webpage. This property has a default value of static which means that the element follows the the normal behavior. It is laid out in its current position on the flow of the document according to the nature of the element being it inline or block. Possible values are relative, absolute & fixed. Each value is explained in detail as given below.

## Relative positioning

Elements are laid out on the webpage & the space of the element is taken into account for positioning the other elements around it. With the relative value, there are four additional properties - top, right, bottom, left. For Example, top 20px; moves the content towards the bottom by 20px, otherwise applies an additional space of 20px on the top.

## Absolute positioning

Absolute posititioning completely removes the content from the flow of the document, which means that the browser will no longer assign any space to the content. Additional properties are top, right, bottom, left.

## Fixed positioning

Same as the absolute positioning value. Content is completely removed from the flow of the document but the additional properties (top, right, bottom, left) will always be relative to the viewport.
